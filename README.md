# HTTPSketch

This Sketch repo is not intended to be the final API or implementation, itâ€™s a prototype of the HTTP API that has been discussed on the mailing list at https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-server-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170403/000422.html

It was created in the hope that a concrete implementation would allow data-driven performance measurements, and thus a more informed and healthier conversation.
